# Answering-Business-Questions-using-SQLite
This is a first guided project of SQL in dataquest, an online platform where you can learn data analysis and science. Guided project is a project where problems are provided and I try to solve them using what I have learned.  In this project, I solved business questions using Sqlite3. A sample database I worked on is Chinook database. The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. The access to the database from here  4 tasks to do  selecting albums to purchase from artsts analyzing employee's performance analyzing sales by country analyzing album purchases and individual tracks purchases.
